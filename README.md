Our main aim in our project is to try to simulate the pheromone navigation algorithm of the ants, as well as to formulate the algorithm and ensure that the agent (ant) goes on the most optimal path. The ant's goal is to try to find the food that has formed at a random point with the help of the algorithm, and after finding it, its goal is to deliver the food to the nest. The aim of this project is to provide a solution to the problem called "Traveling Salesman Problem (TPS)" in the literature. The TPS problem is that a seller who visits each city exactly once finds the shortest round trip route with minimum cost.
